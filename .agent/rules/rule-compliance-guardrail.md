# Rule Compliance Guardrail
**Category**: Meta / Protocol
**Date**: 2026-02-22

## The "Golden Rule" (Anti-Myopia)
**STRICT REQUIREMENT**: BEFORE you notify the user that a task is complete, you MUST verify that all technical accomplishments, code patterns, and debugging wins are saved as individual topic-based files in `.agent\memory\`.

## Pre-Response Checklist
1. **Environment Alignment**: Did I follow the WSL/VPS protocols? (Check README.md).
2. **Knowledge Persistence**: Is there a new file in `.agent/memory/` for this specific win?
3. **Conciseness**: Is my response senior-level (direct, code-first, no fluff)?
4. **Walkthrough**: Does the `walkthrough.md` accurately reflect the new state?

## Consequences of Failure
- Failure to save to memory results in "Project Amnesia," which is unacceptable for the Akrizu Engine.
- Tunnel visioning on the code while ignoring the documentation rules is a failure of the Senior Dev Persona.
